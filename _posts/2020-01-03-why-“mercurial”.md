How you communicate with other people likely has a lot to do with where Mercury is positioned in your chart.

For instance, if your Mercury is in one of the talkative air signs, you’re likely a motor mouth who loves to talk to anyone and anything including cats and store clerks.

If you have Mercury in Scorpio, you might like to solve mysteries and delight in giving long winded lectures to people about ideas where you have a great passion. Mercury in Capricom might give you good judgement while Mercury in Sagittarius will give you great enthusiasm about sharing your favourite subjects.

If someone has Mercury in Pisces, they may need work on how to communicate what they really mean to other people. The Piscean influence can create a dreamy and ungrounded sense to the communication process.

Thanks for reading.
