Astrology is a complex system that uses the position of planets and stars to gather information about the world. Astrologists study the patterns of planets and stars to help provide guidance.

In astrological terms, everybody is born under a particular sign of the Zodiac, depending on their date of birth. Each Zodiac sign is associated with a specific set of characteristics, which are often attributed to those born under that particular sign. Each Zodiac sign is also associated with a particular element (Fire, Water, Earth or Air).

## The Fire Signs: Aries Leo and Sagittarius

People born under a Fire sign can be unpredictable and volatile, sometimes losing their temper easily and launching into an unexpected rage. However, if they can learn to control their impulses and quick-temper, their passion can be channeled into positive pursuits, and they can excel at whatever they choose to do.

Those born under a Fire sign have strong intuitive abilities and an adventurous streak. By following their heart, life will never be dull for someone born under a Fire sign.

Aries, the sign of The Ram, enhances the temperamental qualities of the Fire element. Those bom under Aries tend to be independent and have an enthusiastic attitude to life. Sometimes, they can be self-involved and ignorant of other peopleâ€™s feelings, but this stems from their independent streak, rather than malice.

Leo, the sign of The Lion, combines ambition with loyalty. Those born under Leo enjoy being the center of attention and tend to have grand ambitions, which their determination often helps them to achieve. They can be feisty, eccentric and extremely demanding, but they are also fiercely loyal and dependable.

Sagittarius, the sign of The Archer, combines idealism and creativity. People born under Sagittarius are idealistic and enthusiastic, often with high standards and rigid ideas about how the world should be. They can also be adventurous and creative, which may lead them to seek out worthy causes to support.

## The Water Signs: Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces

People born under a Water sign are intuitive and empathetic. They tend to have good people skills, owing to their extraordinary empathy and understanding of other people. Those born under a Water sign can be very caring and understanding, but their ability to feel strong emotions and empathy can lead to them being over-sensitive and easily offended.

Cancer, the sign of The Crab, enhances the caring aspect of the Water element. Those born under Cancer often care deeply for other people, and can be fiercely protective of their loved ones. However, their need to care for someone can lead to over-dependence on other people, which can sometimes result in aggressive behavior.

Scorpio, the sign of The Scorpion, combines energy and intensity. Those born under Scorpio tend to be full of energy and enthusiasm, which can make them seem dynamic a fun to be around. However, they are also prone to dark moods, and their intense nature can alienate those around them.

Pisces, the sign of The Fish, enhances the emotional aspects of the Water element. Those born under Pisces can be romantic, charming and relaxing to be around. They tend to be compassionate and empathetic, as well as highly intuitive. However, those born under Pisces sometimes have a tendency to live in a fantasy world, rather than reality.

## The Earth Signs: Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn

People born under an Earth sign are sturdy and dependable. They are well-grounded and their dreams are firmly rooted in reality. However, those born under an Earth sign can be overly concerned with material possessions, social status and the outside appearance of people and objects. They sometimes lack spiritual awareness, as they are concerned more with what they can see, hear and touch.

Taurus, the sign of The Bull, combines practicality with creativity. Those born under Taurus are practical and well-grounded, with a firm grasp on the real world. They can be creative, dependable and extremely loyal. However, those born under Taurus can also be possessive and stubborn, sometimes upsetting people with their dark moods.

Virgo, the sign of The Virgin, combines practicality with reliability. Those born under Virgo are highly practical, dependable and reliable. They are often quick-thinking and able to find solutions to practical problems. However, those born under Virgo can be obsessive, and sometimes push people away with their overly-independent nature.

Capricorn, the sign of The Goat, enhances the materialistic nature of the Earth element. Those born under Capricorn tend to be concerned with material possessions. They are highly organised and focused on achieving material goals, which often makes them successful in business. However, those born under Capricorn can take life too seriously, and may miss out on the fun side of life.

## The Air Signs: Gemini, Libra and Aquarius

People born under an Air sign are concerned with matters of the mind. They place great significance on intellectual matters, and enjoy coming up with solutions to problems.

People born under an Air sign often have little understanding of emotional matters, as they prefer to concentrate on rational and mental matters. This can bring great rewards for those involved in intellectual projects, but leave them lacking in meaningful personal relationships.

Gemini, the sign of The Twins, combines unpredictability with curiosity. People born under Gemini have a great curiosity and thirst for knowledge. They have a strong desire to meet new people and learn new things. However, they can also be unpredictable and flighty. Those born under Gemini do not like to stay in stale relationships, much preferring to move on when the excitement has gone.

Libra, the sign of The Scales, combines intellectual and creative qualities. Those born under Libra are intelligent and mentally alert, as well as creative. They strive to achieve balance in their lives, and often have a calming influence on those around them. However, those born under Libra often try to please everyone, which prevents them from living the life they want.

Aquarius, the sign of The Water Bearer, combines intellectual qualities with idealistic values. Those born under Aquarius have their own ideas about how the world should be, and often strive to change thingsfor the better. They are at their best when fighting for a cause they believe in. However, those born under Aquarius can be overly-independent and unpredictable.

It should be remembered that, while astrology can provide a basic outline of the characteristics associated with each Zodiac sign and element, the human personality is made up of many different things, including past experience and the attitudes of those around us. Astrology can only show us our tendencies, rather than complete facts.
