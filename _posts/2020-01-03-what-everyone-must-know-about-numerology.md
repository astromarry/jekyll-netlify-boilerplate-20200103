Numerology is a divinatory art that is often associated with the occult and astrology. Whereas astrologists use astronomical formations to gain information about the earth, numerologists use numbers.

A numerologist might use the numbers of your birth date or a set of numbers corresponding to the letters in your name to try to help you understand your inclinations and personality traits. There is no official certification for numerologists. If you want to become a numerologist, you can attend a private school or you can study on your own.

## Study Numerology at Home

Itâ€™s best to begin by obtaining an array of numerology books from a local library or bookstore. Study these books thoroughly. You will discover that there are a number of different schools of thought concerning numerology, such as Chaldean and Pythagorean.

Learn the history of these schools, and what the differences are between them. Even if you have already decided that you are only interested in practicing one school of numerology, it will still be worth your while to learn how other schools work.

Acquire a selection of numerology reference books for your personal library. Even numerologists with decades of experience need to refer to their books on a regular basis.
