  If you were born between 23rd July and 23rd August you’ll come under the fire
  sign of Leo. As a typical Leo, you’ll be an extrovert charmer, a leader who
  sets high standard for both yourself and your followers. Your enthusiasm and
  hard work, combined with your organizational skills will help you achieve your
  ambitions.


  But what does this mean when it comes to ideal jobs for you? You’ll be happy
  in a role that allows you to indulge your-natural flair for putting on a show,
  so the theater, media or fashion are ideal fields for you. You’d make a good
  motivational speaker, actor or presenter. Your natural leadership will stand
  you in good stead if you decide to take on a more serious role, such as law
  enforcement or the armed forces.
