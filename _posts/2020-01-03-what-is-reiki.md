  Reiki is healing method that relies on channeling life force energy, or Chi
  through the hands. According to Reiki theory, we have energy centers located
  throughout our bodies that facilitate the flow of Chi. The underlying belief
  is that a healthy physical body correlates strongly with balanced & smooth
  flowing Chi through our energy centers.

Conversely, Chi energy that is blocked by poorly functioning energy centers may result in disease. When a Reiki practitioner lays her hands on a client, she becomes a vessel for this life force energy to flowfrom the universe through her body. This Chi energy is then channeled through her hands and into the other person to clear the obstructions that are predisposing the disease.
