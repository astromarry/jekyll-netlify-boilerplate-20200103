  Every year, when events rolls around, we’re again faced with the challenge of
  finding gifts for family members and friends— not only something that’s
  unique, but something that’s also a little different to what we bought them
  last event! The following is a selection of gift ideas for individuals based
  on their star sign to help with one of the most challenging aspects of the
  festive season.
---
## Aries (March 21 —April 19)

Aries are trail-blazers. They’re also bom leaders. These are the people who are always first in line, and the first to see and hear the latest releases. Give them a ticket to a brand new show that’s just opened in town, that way they get to be the first to see it — and guaranteed, when the doors open, they’ll be there!

## Taurus (April zo —May zo)

Taurus loves to be pampered. They love to be spoiled. Treat them to a day at a spa or a facial or massage at their local beauty salon. Failing that, find the biggest box of top-quality chocolates you can — you are bound to see your Taurus act more kitten-like than bull-like!

## Gemini (May 21 —June 21)

Gemini is the true culture-vulture. These people love the arts: opera, ballet, and the symphony. Buy your Gemini a ticket for one of these performances, and you’ll be guaranteed to hear about it — in Gemini’s inimitable way — for the rest of the year!

## Cancer (June 22 —July 22)

Cancer people are home-makers and home-lovers — and very often great cooks! Anything to do with the home or garden will be a bit hit. A pretty basket filled with cooking herbs, spices, oils, and condiments is be one gift your Cancer will adore.

## Leo (July 23 – August 22)

No one in the world is as important to a Leo as he or she N You must buy something that’s very much about Mr. or Ms Leo. Furs jewels, and fine lingerie are a few suggestions. Just make sure your gift isn’t something that’s used around the home!

## Virgo (August 23 -September 22)

Virgo is the “serving” sign of the Zodiac. This is the person who will be delighted to receive a card from a charity informing her (or him) that in lieu of a gift this year a needy farmer in Africa will be receiving a goat.

## Libra (September 23 – October 22)

Libra is all about balance and harmony, Yin and Yang, mind and body. Most Librans like to look good, so membership to a local fitness centre will be very much appreciated; or perhaps a new pair of running shoes or yoga pants

## Scorpio (October 23 — November 21)

Scorpio — as they are probably tired of hearing — are the dark mysterious (not to mention sexy) members of the Zodiac. If you’re on intimate terms with your Scorpio then buy her (or him) a gift that just the two of you can enjoy when you’re alone behind closed doors. If your Scorpio is your mother-in-law, however, then perhaps you’d better make it a fine silk scarf— in a daring and sexy color, of course!

## Sagittarius (November 22- December 21)

Sagittarius loves to travel. Buy your Sagittarius a weekend break somewhere they’ve never been before; or if they’ve got a trip planned, then a new travel case or piece of luggage. These Zodiac types can be daring, too, so a trip in a hot air balloon would be one they’d remember for quite a while!

## Capricorn (December 22 – Januaryig)

These are the perfectionists of the Zodiac, so this might be difficult. However, if you do put a little effort into a great gift, no one will appreciate it more than Capricorn! These people like to save for a rainy day, so perhaps an unusual piggy bank could be just the thing.

## Aquarius (January zo — February 18)

Aquarius people love gadgetry, so they’ll want anything technological that’s new on the market. It doesn’t have to be expensive or useful: as long as it’s new and requires batteries, they’ll want it!

## Pisces (February 19 — March 20)

Pisces are the dreamers of the astrological world. How about buying them their own star? These aren’t the types who have to be surrounded by materials possessions so having a star named after him or her would be one gift they’d love. Pisces people are also big animal lovers, so you could adopt an animal for your Pisces as part of a wildlife conversation project that would work just as well.

Providing you know the birth dates of all your nearest and dearest, you can buy them something they’ll love. So that’s one challenging aspect of festive season over with; now you just have to work out how you’re going to fit them all round the dining table for dinner!
