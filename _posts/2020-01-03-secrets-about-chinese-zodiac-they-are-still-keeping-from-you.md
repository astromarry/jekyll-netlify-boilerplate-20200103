The Chinese Zodiac is made up of twelve animal signs, one for each year of a twelve-year cycle. The fifth sign is the sign of the Dragon. Each animal sign is paired with an biannual element. Each element predominates for two years at a time. The elements of the Chinese Zodiac are Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire.

Therefore, a person born in a Year of the Dragon is an Earth Dragon (1988), a Metal Dragon poll), a Water Dragon (1952), a Wood Dragon (1964), or a Fire Dragon (1976). All people bom in a Year of the Dragon share certain characteristics, while other characteristics differ based on their elemental years.

In addition to the biannual element, each animal sign has a ruling element based on the animal’s predominant nature. The ruling element of the Dragon sign is the element of Wood. The Dragon shares the ruling Wood element with the Tiger and Rabbit signs.

Each animal sign is also assigned to one of four groups of three, or trines. Individuals in each time are most compatible with one another, and least compatible with individuals from certain other trines. The Dragon is in the First Trine with the Rat and the Monkey.

Each animal sign, biannual element, ruling element, and trine has certain characteristics. Some of the characteristics of a person who is a Dragon sign are shared with all other individuals of that sign, trine, and ruling element, and others are influenced by their biannual element and shared with other people who were born in the other animal years of that element.

Dragon, Rat, and Monkey individuals all share the first trine characteristics of intensity and power. They all have great leadership ability, but also great potential for doing both good and evil. They can have poor judgment or bad tempers when they are frustrated, and may allowtheir emotional reactions to get the better of them. First time people can be very unpredictable.

## Chinese Year of Rabbit

February 3rd 2011 marks the first day of the Chinese year of the Rabbit while the last day falls on 23rd January 2012. The Rabbit is the fourth of twelve animals in the Chinese zodiac. Each 12-yearly cycle in the zodiac is also associated with one of five elements, metal, water, wood, fire, and earth, in that order. Those born in the 2011 year of the rabbit will be Metal Rabbits.

Rabbits are known to be creative, caring, sensitive and graceful. They are often friendly, extroverted people who prefer to be in the company of family and friends. Because of their sensitive nature, Rabbits tend to avoid conflict.

Instead, they often take on the role of mediator, particularly as they are popular among friends and family. The creative nature of the Rabbit is complemented with good artistic sense and taste. They are often well-dressed and their homes are typically tastefully decorated. Rabbits also tend to be home-bodies, preferring to entertain from the comforts of home.

## Chinese Year of Tiger

Valentine’s Day next year is not just for lovers worldwide. February 14 2010 also ushers in the Chinese New Year of the Tiger.

The tiger is a fierce creature, wild and free, brave and commanding. In Chinese astrology, those born in the year of the Tiger enjoy the same characteristics. The third sign in the Chinese Zodiac, Tigers are known to be courageous, charming, and ambitious.

A born leader, Tigers will show their dominance, whether in the boardroom or the bedroom. The Tiger’s aggression can translate into fights and quarrels, and they can be rash and impatient. However, their charm will usually get them out of serious scrapes.

According to Chinese Astrology, the five elements of metal, water, wood, fire and earth greatly affect one’s personality. Next year’s Metal Tiger has steely qualities, and is generally known to be aggressive, inflexible, cold and uncompromising.

Water Tigers, born in the years 1902 and 1962 are the most mellow of all the Tigers, and are thought to be sensitive, caring and people focused. Wood Tigers (1914, 1974) are flexible, compassionate, and highly principled. Fire Tigers (1926, 1986) are passionate, and expressive, but can also be highly impatient.

The Earth Tiger (1938, 1998) is grounded and down to earth. Known to be organized and disciplined, Earth Tigers prefer to analyze a situation in detail before they make a decision.
