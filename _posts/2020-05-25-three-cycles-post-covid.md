1/....... It's time for rebirth and the start of a whole new cycle in your life however you that you must be on your guard against certain exterior elements that may perturb you during this same period and which, if you are not careful, could ruin your chances for success. You will need to be very vigilant and must be ready to put yourself in just the right place and at the right time to make the most of these opportunities which will be available to you over these three months.\
